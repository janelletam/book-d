## What this project does
Book’d is a website where students meet into groups of up to 5 people to form a study session. Users would create an account and rank their proficiency level on a subject, beginner, intermediate, or advanced. From there, students can browse profiles to meet other students that share their interests, and they may then chat with them to form a group to study with. Once students have completed a study session, they can rate how their experience was with the group formed. This feedback system will give users an average rating, so that people know who and who not to study with during their time on Book'd.

## Why this project is useful
We recognized that the main reason for pursuing a college career is to further education, thus, this is what we decided to base our service on. The pandemic has hindered many students’ ability to focus on studying effectively and with a purpose. We acknowledge that a safe, productive learning environment is a inclusive and diverse space where students feel supported by educators, mentors, and their peers. This learning space may also introduce new methods to learning, and for mentors or higher level students, this space will assist them in reinforcing what they have already learned. These concerns are what our concept for a service stems from. This project will assist students with making the most of their time studying.

## How we built this 
To create this service, the tools we utilized were Qoom, Bootstrap, and GitHub. The user interface for Book'd was designed using Qoom, a "web app development platform." Qoom was also used to incorporate a login/sign up system that would store user information in a database. The front-end of Book'd was created using the Bootstrap framework. This provider offered us with website templates, as well as their HTML and CSS code, so we didn't have to start from scratch. GitHub is a software development application that keeps track of project version control. We chose GitHub to keep our work in a repository because we used Qoom to develop the majority of our product.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are proud of learning how to utilize the tools used to create our project. Since we are beginners, many of these tools were new to us, so we had to learn as we continued conducting our project. One of the things we are most proud of is being able to utilize the Qoom database to store user information when it is input into the sign up page.

## What is next for this project
We plan to continue adding to this project by making the webpages our own, and creating a fully functional service later down the road.
